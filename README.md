# people-entry-site

This is a site build for those who want to calculate people entering an event and to know the total number of people entered that event.
Example:

 ----> For those who want to calculate how many people entered in a marriage hall.
 
 ----->To calculate How many people daily going to a particular Bus Stand.

I had builded this project via HTML, CSS , JS.
